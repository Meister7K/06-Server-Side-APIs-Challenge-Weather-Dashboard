# 06-Server-Side-APIs-Challenge-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

- A weather dashboard that displays current weather and future forecasts for searched cities. This page uses openweather API to produce the weather data displayed on the page. 

- In this project I learned how to set up API calls and import the data into useable information on the site. 

## Usage

- The main use for this page is to view the current and future weather forecast for cities you search for.
